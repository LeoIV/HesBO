# High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization
This repository includes several implementations of high dimensional BO, mainly the projection methods. There are two main category of projection based BO methods, REMBO and HeSBO. There are also the implementations of HeSBO embedding method on both BLOSSOM and Cornell-MOE which are the state-of-the-art low dimensional BO methods.

## Installing the requirements
The codes are written in python 3.6, so it is recommended to use this version of python to run the scripts. To install the requrements one can simply use this line:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running different BO methods
There are three different variants of REMBO implemented in this code.
